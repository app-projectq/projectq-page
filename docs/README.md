## What
This app makes it possible for Apple Card owners to generate a QFX file of their **recent ("Latest Transactions") transactions**.

## How
A typical workflow (one that I use on a daily basis)

1. Open Wallet, take a screenshot of recent transactions.
2. Share the screenshot with 'TransactQ' app to convert.
3. Open 'TransactQ' app.
4. Share the QFX file 
	1. to AirDrop
	2. save to a file
	3. email as an attachment

### Detail steps
1. Open Wallet. Scroll down to the list of "Latest Transactions"
2. Take a screenshot
3. Crop the view to the list of transactions that you want to export. **Tip**: Make sure to crop out the logo's on the left side and the '>' on the right side.
4. Select to "Share" the screenshot using the "square-up-arrow button" on the top right corner.
	1. Find the 'TransactQ' icon in the second row (you might need to scroll right to find more icons). 
	2. Click on the 'TransactQ' icon. 
	3. Click on 'Post' to share.
	4. Click on 'Done' and then 'Delete Screenshot'
5. Open 'TransactQ'
6. You should see the screenshot you just shared.
7. Click on the List icon on the bottom right to see the list of transactions (converted from the screenshot).
8. Select to "Share" the list as a QFX file using the "square-up-arrow button" on the top right corner.
9. Choose how you want to share. I usually just AirDrop it to my laptop from which I can import directly into Quicken.


## Tips
* Make a good screenshot
	* crop out the logo's on the left side and the '>' on the right side of the list
	* screen contrast is not too low. Increase the screen contrast value if it appears the app failed to convert text correctly.
* Use your screenshot right away. While you can take a screenshot and open later, it is best to take a screenshot and use it right away. The Wallet "Latest Transactions" might have relative date/time text such as "2 hours ago". Those texts will have value relative to when you open the screenshot rather than at the time of the screenshot.

## FAQ
Q. **I thought Apple Wallet can export QFX file**.

A. Currently, Apple will only export the QFX file for transactions from your monthly statement. This means recent transactions are not available to be exported.

Q. **How to contact you**?

A. Email to <app.projectq@gmail.com>

Q. **Will it work with Wallet in dark mode**?

A. Yes

Q. **Why some transactions are not selected for export to QFX**?

A. Transactions with 'Pending' are not selected because they are likely to be changed again. Just wait until those transactions are no longer 'Pending'. Also, transactions with errors (you will see a small yellow 'T' to indicate an error in the text portion) are not selected.

Q. **In the List view, there are red (-) and green (+) icons, what are they**?

A. Red (-) are for debits and Green (+) are for payments.

## About us
Hi there,

We are a team of three: father (Hung), daughter (Amanda), and son (Chris).

I work as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, and Amanda and Chris are seniors in high school.

This product first started out as a one-weekend project for personal use. Then I got a few emails inquiring about it. Soon, it became quite clear that I need to treat this as a release product: it needs to be built, QA’ed, packaged, and released properly. I also need to create a web site, get the word out, handle customer emails … Then it dawned on me that this project would be a perfect vehicle to introduce my daughter and son to what it is like to create a product, market it, support it and interact with paying customers. And that is how Amanda and Chris got involved!

We strive to make you a happy customer.

We make sure our product is well-tested and works correctly for the first time. On our website, we clearly explain what our product does. If you have questions or concerns, we will give your email our full attention and get back to you promptly.

Thank you for your support,

Hung/Amanda/Chris
