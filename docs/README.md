## Tips

* Crop the screenshot to include only the transacions. Make sure to exclude 
  ** the logo on the left side
  ** and the '>' characters on the right side
* You can exclude a transaction from the OFX file by uncheck a checkmark. You might want to do that if you notice that the 
transaction might have incorrect information.
* If the app has problem recognizing some of the texts, increase screen brightness when taking the screenshot.
* If there is a letter (D) next to the date. That means the date was derived from text string as such as '2 hours ago' 
or 'Wednesday'. In such case, the date might be different depending on when you generate the OFX file.
